# FSC

A newer version of the Fizanyatik Sports Club App, the FSC App has an updated UI matched with the new Material Design 3 Language supporting Dynamic colors as well!

The language used is Android Java and XML for designing UI elements.

The app is open source with MIT Lisence and you are free to use the app as a whole or fragments of it on your own projects. For commercial uses, just provide a reference to my work in you project.
